      We use organic, non-GMO products, grains with high protein content such as quinoa, kiwicha, and purple corn. In addition, we have a wide variety of potatoes at your disposal. These vary according to the region and have different textures and colors. For example, yucca, native to the tropical jungle near Cusco and Machu Picchu, is a tuber that can serve as an accompaniment to a seafood or meat dish.
